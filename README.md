# AnimatedBezierCurve
Produces an interactive "animated" altair chart of a bezier curve saved as a html

## Tutorial
All you have to do is call the "animate_bezier" function in "animate.py".

It will then save a .html of the altair chart to the specified download path (set to the system downloads folder as default).

The chart is interactive so you can move the grid/chart and zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.

You can step through the parametric t values by using the slider at the bottom to "animate" the curve.
