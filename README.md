# AnimatedBezierCurve
Produces an interactive "animated" altair chart of a bezier curve saved as a html

## Tutorial
All you have to do is call the "animate_bezier" function in "animate.py".

It will then save a .html of the altair chart.

The chart is interactive and you can zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.

You can step through the parametric t values by using the slider at the bottom to "animate" the curve.
